      <p> America is a land of immigrants. Whether our ancestors came here 500 years ago, or you're the first in your family to move here, we want to make you feel welcome. Village is a way for you to meet other immigrants who have recently moved to the same area as you. You will be able to meet with the people that you meet on this website at our designated "safe spaces". We have a variety of "safe spaces" that are sure to interest you and your new found friends. Here at village we have seen first hand how lonley it can be to move to a new country and your happiness is important to us.  </p>
